Welcome to Version3.x - Join me in my journey exploring all things Web 3.0! I am pro-decentralization in all sectors and believe that the decentralization movement is the ultimate pro-choice, pro-freedom and the future of technology, finance, health, tourism, entertainment, and anything else you can think of.
<p>
My name is Sabrina and I am based in the remote island of Seychelles where blockchain is almost unheard of, and crypto is unregulated (for now). This may very possibly be Seychelles' first decentralized website.
<p>
There has been a lot of talk about the possibility of digitalizing our currency (Seychelles Rupee or SCR) in the next few years but I don't know how possible this would be for various reasons that I don't need to mention right now.
<p>
When I started building websites and discovered the joys and ease of open-source resources, I was very quickly convinced that freeware and shareware was the future.  You develop something that others can use and build on, and they develop something that you can also use and build upon. Unfortunately, I very quickly realized that if I wanted this site to be decentralized, it would have to be limited to HTML, CSS and JS for now. I'll have to plan the design of it later, I just want this up asap.
<p>
I am not ready for all this new technology and where the world is headed but I believe that I don't really have a choice but to jump on board and be part of what's imminent.
<p>
Everything that I write on this site is subjective and I offer no financial advice. I cite links to all resources used and as much as possible I do not visit nor share links to sites that may be harmful or lack credibility.
